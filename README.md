This repository contains the code and resources for two capstone projects:

**Ad Click Analysis:** Focused on analyzing ad click data, this project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and the implementation of machine learning models to optimize ad placements. It features visualizations and performance metrics for predictive models, providing insights into user behavior and trends.

**Mpox Outbreak Analysis:** This project analyzes the mpox (monkeypox) outbreak and features interactive dashboards developed using Power BI to visualize key epidemiological metrics, including cases, deaths, and demographic trends. The project emphasizes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insights derived from the "MPOX" dataset to support public health decision-making.

Both projects are ideal for those interested in data-driven marketing, public health analytics, and machine learning applications.
