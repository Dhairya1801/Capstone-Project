# **Capstone Project**
## **MONKEY POX OUTBREAK**
### **1. Executive Summary:**
This project leverages data from the "MPOX" dataset to develop interactive dashboards using 
Power BI, providing insights into the spread and impact of mpox. The dashboards will display 
key epidemiological metrics, such as total cases, deaths, and trends over time, to support public 
health decision-making.

### 2. Problem Statement:
**Background:** Limited access to real-time data on mpox cases and deaths across regions 
hampers the ability of health officials to respond effectively to outbreaks.

**Objective:** Develop dashboards to monitor and analyse the spread of mpox, focusing on new 
and total cases, deaths, and regional trends.

**Scope:** Initial focus on analysing mpox data by location, WHO region, and demographic trends 
across different time periods.

### **3. Data Sources:**
**Primary Data:** The "MPOX" dataset, which includes daily reported data on cases, deaths, and 
population-adjusted metrics provided by the ‘WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO)’.

### **4. Methodology:**
**Data Integration:** Extract and integrate data from the "MPOX" dataset into Tableau/Power BI to 
provide a unified view of mpox spread and impact.

**Dashboard Design:** Collaborate with epidemiologists and public health stakeholders to identify 
key metrics and design visually informative dashboards.

**Interactivity:** Implement interactive features for users to explore trends by date, region, and 
case metrics.

### **5. Expected Outcomes:**
- Interactive dashboards providing real-time insights into mpox case numbers and 
mortality rates.
- Enhanced decision-making for public health response through visual representation of 
epidemiological trends.
- Improved data accessibility for healthcare providers and policymakers to coordinate 
effective interventions.

### **6. Tools and Technologies:**
- Tableau/Power BI for dashboard development.
- MS Excel and Python for data extraction and transformation.
 
### **7. Risks and Challenges:**
- Ensuring data accuracy and consistency across different regions and over time.
- Integration challenges when adding additional datasets or real-time data feeds.
- User adoption challenges for public health officials unfamiliar with data visualization 
tools.

### **8. Conclusion:**
This project aims to provide public health agencies with comprehensive and visually engaging 
dashboards, enabling a deeper understanding of the mpox outbreak and facilitating timely and 
informed decision-making. By focusing on critical metrics such as case counts, death rates, and 
regional trends, the dashboards will help enhance public health responses and resource 
allocation
